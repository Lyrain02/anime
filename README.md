# Anime System
This is a class project for Database System and Application, 2021 Spring, based on RDBMS. We built a quering system for animations. Our data is from [Anime Recommendation Database 2020](https://www.kaggle.com/hernan4444/anime-recommendation-database-2020?select=watching_status.csv).

I was responsible for the data processing, schema and sql design, and Evan Li undertook the job for front end and back end.
